# **Project** - Flight-Fare-Prediction ðŸ›«

**Objective** - Predicting the Flight Fare for various airlines on the basis of given features like Date of Journey, Source,  Destination, Duration etc.

**Approach** 

â€¢ Created a Machine Learning model to predict the prices of Flight in India to help user book the tickets in advance and have an estimate over the price.

â€¢ Engineered feature such as "Date of Journey," "Duration", "Departure Time", "Arrival Time" of flight. The features where quantified to fed to the ML Model.

â€¢ Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.

â€¢ Till now Random Forest & XGBoost Regressor has given the best results in terms of Accuracy & Root mean square error(RMSE).

â€¢ In Process to build a client facing app
